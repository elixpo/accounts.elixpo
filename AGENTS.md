# Agent Guidelines for accounts.elixpo

OAuth 2.0 Identity Provider. Next.js 15 on Cloudflare Pages (edge runtime), Cloudflare D1 (SQLite), Web Crypto. This file is the operating manual for any agent or AI teammate working in this repo.

## Architecture

- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Pages (edge) via `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`. Node.js APIs are NOT available at runtime.
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite). Access via `src/lib/db.ts` and the `d1-client` helper.
- **Auth**: JWT access (15 min) + refresh (rotated) tokens in httpOnly cookies. Sign/verify in `src/lib/jwt.ts` (Web Crypto).
- **Email**: Dual transport — `cloudflare:sockets` SMTP in prod (`src/lib/smtp-client.ts`), `nodemailer` fallback in local dev (dynamically imported via string concat to hide from esbuild).
- **Crypto**: Web Crypto API only. All primitives in `src/lib/webcrypto.ts` (UUID, random string, hashing, AES). No Node `crypto`.
- **UI**: MUI v7 + Emotion + Tailwind v4. React 19.

External consumers of the OAuth API: see `docs/OAUTH_INTEGRATION.md`.

## Hard Constraints (edge runtime)

These will break the Cloudflare Pages build or fail at runtime if violated:

- **Every API route MUST export `export const runtime = 'edge'`** — missing this makes the route attempt Node runtime and the build fails.
- **Never import Node built-ins** (`crypto`, `fs`, `path`, `stream`, `buffer`). Use Web APIs or the helpers in `src/lib/webcrypto.ts`. `Buffer` is polyfilled in some contexts but don't rely on it — use `Uint8Array` + `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`.
- **`nodemailer` is dev-only.** It's dynamically imported with string concat (`const mailer = await import('node' + 'mailer')`) so esbuild can't see it. Never `import nodemailer from 'nodemailer'` at top level — that bundles it and the build fails.
- **D1 is SQLite, not Postgres.** No `RETURNING *` on multi-row operations (D1 supports single-row RETURNING only), no window functions in older binding versions, no `JSONB`. Test multi-row queries locally against `wrangler d1 execute --local`.
- **KV has eventual consistency** (up to 60s globally). Never use KV as the source of truth for auth state — D1 is authoritative.

## Migrations

- Location: `src/workers/migrations/NNNN_<name>.sql`. Number is gapless — pick the next integer.
- Apply locally: `npm run db:migrate:local` (re-runs the whole schema), or `wrangler d1 migrations apply elixpo_auth --local`.
- Apply to prod: `npm run db:migrate` (remote). Do this **only** via a merged PR + deploy, never from a dev machine manually.
- Rollbacks are manual — write a reverse SQL file; do not delete the forward migration.
- When adding a column that will be indexed, the index statement goes in the same migration file.

## Biome Workflow

Biome is the single linter/formatter (eslint-config-next is vestigial). The wrapper is `./biome.sh`:

- `./biome.sh` — apply safe + unsafe fixes, quiet output. Run this after edits.
- `./biome.sh ci` — strict check, exit 0 required before commit. CI runs this.
- `./biome.sh check` — full diagnostic report, no writes.

`noExplicitAny` is set to `info` (warnings, not errors) because `any` is used intentionally at OAuth/auth boundaries where runtime validation handles the shape. Don't add `any` elsewhere just to silence the linter.

## Testing

- **No test runner is wired yet.** Verification is manual: `npm run dev` + curl or browser. When adding tests, use `vitest` + `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` (matches the Workers pool pattern in pollinations/enter).
- For API changes, the verification loop is:
  1. `npm run dev` (runs Next in dev mode, not on CF pages)
  2. `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/...` with a seeded test user
  3. Check `wrangler d1 execute elixpo_auth --local --command "SELECT ..."` for DB state
- For edge-runtime-specific code (anything using Web Crypto / cf bindings), run `npm run pages:build` — this is the only way to catch edge incompat before prod.
- Never add a test that depends on `node-*` packages (they won't run under the Workers pool).

## Git & PR Workflow

- **Never commit to `main`.** It's branch-protected anyway, but don't try.
- Branch naming: `elixpo/<issue-n>-<hex>` for agent-driven, `feat/<slug>` / `fix/<slug>` for manual.
- Commit format: conventional — `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`. Include `(#N)` for the issue or PR reference.
- PR title: `[ELIXPO] <short>` for agent PRs, plain conventional otherwise.
- PR body ends with `Fixes #N` so GitHub auto-closes on merge.
- Run `./biome.sh ci` before every commit. CI will reject otherwise.
- Before pushing, verify branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.
- Follow-ups on a merged PR go in a **new** branch — don't revive a merged branch.

See `.claude/commands/commit-push-pr.md` for the branch-state decision tree.

## Common Mistakes (learned from incidents)

These are mistakes agents and contributors have actually made in this repo. Read before touching unfamiliar areas.

- **Forgetting `export const runtime = 'edge'`** on a new API route → build fails with a cryptic edge-runtime error. Always add it.
- **Top-level `import nodemailer`** → bundled into edge output, build fails. Keep the dynamic `'node' + 'mailer'` pattern.
- **Using `crypto.randomUUID()` from Node** → Runtime error. Use `webcrypto.randomUUID()` from `src/lib/webcrypto.ts`.
- **`fetch` without `cache: 'no-store'`** on routes that need fresh data → Next caches aggressively. Set `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` or use `cache: 'no-store'`.
- **Adding a new OAuth scope without updating `src/lib/oauth-config.ts`** → consent screen won't show it, token endpoint silently drops it.
- **Mutating the JWT payload after sign** → signature mismatch. Build the payload object, then sign.
- **Skipping rate-limit middleware on a public auth endpoint** → abuse vector. All public `/api/auth/*` routes must wrap in `rateLimitMiddleware`.
- **Running `wrangler d1 migrations apply` manually on remote** from a dev box. Prod migrations go through CI only.
- **Using `Buffer.from(...).toString('base64')`** → `Buffer` is not reliable at edge. Use `btoa(String.fromCharCode(...bytes))` or the base64 helper in `webcrypto.ts`.

## Communication Style

Applies to PR bodies, issue comments, code review output.

- Bullets over paragraphs. <200 words unless the change is genuinely large.
- Facts, not opinions. Link specific lines (`src/lib/jwt.ts:42`) instead of "the JWT stuff".
- No marketing language ("seamlessly", "robust", "leveraging").
- No hedging ("I think", "maybe", "might want to"). Either it's right or it's not.
- In reviews: focus on what needs improving, not what's already fine. Don't repeat the obvious.

Agent voice specifically: **never say "Claude", "Claude Code", "AI", "LLM", "analyzing", "analysis"**. Speak as a teammate — "looking into this", "pushed a fix", "opened #N".

## Workflow Orchestration (for agents)

- Read `.elixpo-context/context.md` ONCE at the start. Don't `ls`/`find`/`tree` to rediscover what's already on disk.
- Read the trigger (issue or PR) ONCE. Don't repeat `gh pr view` with different `--json` flags.
- Stay strictly in scope. No side quests into other repos, no unrelated refactors.
- For issue work, the decision tree is in `.claude/commands/respond-to-issue.md` — follow it.
- For commit/push/PR, follow `.claude/commands/commit-push-pr.md`.
- Delegate only when it earns its cost. Subagents (`architect`, `red-team`, `refiner`, etc. — pulled from `@elixpo/claudeops`) add turns; skip them for trivial fixes.

## Security Rules

- Never log request bodies that could contain passwords, tokens, or OTPs. Redact at the middleware layer.
- Never expose D1 errors to clients verbatim — they leak query structure. Use `ApiError` from `src/lib/api-auth-middleware.ts` with a sanitized message.
- Client secrets in OAuth are returned **once at creation** and hashed before storage. Never log the raw secret.
- Webhook signing secrets are per-endpoint; rotate via the dashboard, not by editing D1 directly.
- CORS: only the explicit allow-list in `next.config.ts` or per-route `OPTIONS` handler. Don't `*` anything behind auth.

## Deployment

- Merges to `main` auto-deploy via Cloudflare Pages Git integration.
- Preview deployments per PR — URL in the PR status check.
- Secrets live in Cloudflare Pages dashboard and `.env.local` for dev. `.env.example` is the authoritative list of required vars.
- `deploy.sh` is for manual wrangler deploys only (rarely needed).

## Monitoring

- Prometheus metrics at `/api/metrics` (internal auth required).
- Grafana dashboards + alert rules in `monitoring/`.
- Admin notifications via `src/lib/admin-notifications.ts` (fires on RBAC events, mass failures, suspicious activity).
